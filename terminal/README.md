# Terminal Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal terminal-style portfolio template built with React and Tailwind CSS.
It includes:
- Typed welcome message
- Commands: help, about, projects, contact, theme, resume, clear
- Tab completion, command history (↑/↓), and an easter egg `sudo hire enoch`

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## How to preview quickly in CodeSandbox
1. Upload the project folder (or zip) to CodeSandbox by dragging the folder into https://codesandbox.io/s
2. Wait for it to install dependencies, then preview the app.

Customize the sample projects and contact details in `src/Terminal.jsx`.
